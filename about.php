Hello! I'm Amelia Fuesz, a senior CMIS (Computer Management and Info. Sys.) student. This site began  as a weekend side project to build on my knowledge of PHP and MySQL. As an avid baker, home chef, and somewhat foodie, I love trying new recipes! However, I usually forget to write them down afterwards. This has led to more time being spent trying to figure out my measurements and ingredients than I'd care for. Because of this, I decided to create my own database of recipes based not on ingredients, but on the "food mood" that I'm in at the moment. So many times I wished I could search for recipes based on hot/cold food and the overall taste of the dish instead of ingredients. Thus, this website was born!

Well, I hope you enjoy your time here and find some interesting recipes to try! If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me <a href="http://imagine-reality.net/contact.php">here</a>.

<br><br>
Thank you, and happy cooking! :)
<br>
~ Amelia
