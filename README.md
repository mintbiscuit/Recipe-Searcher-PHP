Recipe-Searcher-PHP
===================

A PHP-based web application that searches recipes on a MySQL database based on user's preferences.

About
-----

This site was created for two reasons: an exercise in PHP/MySQL and because I needed a storage location for my favorite recipes that was easily accessible. In addition, unlike other recipe search applications which rely on ingredients or recipe name to search, I wanted to be able to search a database on personal taste criteria (such as sweet/salty/savory or hot/cold food). This web application has an easy-to-use interface that a user can make decisions with. After making an initial decision, the user is given several options (if applicable with their criteria) to choose from. After clicking on the one they like, they are transported to a page displaying their desired recipe!

Live Preview and Future Plans
-----------------------------

The project is still under construction as I slowly build up the recipe database with my favorite options. In addition, GF/SF/DF functionality has not been implemented quite yet for the search function. I currently have plans to implement an "Add Recipe" section for visitors to add their favorite recipes. In the future, I plan to work on constructing a mobile application (likely on Android and possibly on iOS devices) that allows users to interact with this database as well as a personal, local (on their device) to store recipes they do not necessarily wish to put on the internet, but that they wish to have a copy of on their mobile. Big plans ahead! :)

Here is the current live preview (remember it is still a work in progress):
